    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These are the best I've had, short of the actual grilling method of course! This is a very simple recipe that I came up with a few years ago. It's not rocket science, just ribs cooked in the slow cooker and finished in the oven. This is what I do when I want ribs during the week and have to work all day. I'm eating them within a half-hour of getting home, and they turn out perfect every time!    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds baby back ribs, trimmed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Season ribs with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour water into slow cooker. Layer the ribs into the slow cooker. Top the ribs with onion and garlic.</li>
        <li>Cook on High for 4 hours (or Low for 8 hours).</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer ribs to a baking sheet. Discard onion and garlic. Coat ribs with barbeque sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until the sauce caramelizes and sticks to the meat, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
